We're coming! Come on! Come on! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. I'll cover you.

Move! Move! The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!

Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage. Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't miss it. How are we doing? The same as always. That bad, huh? Where's Leia? I'm here. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.

If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. Father, please. Help me. Now, young Skywalker...you will die.
